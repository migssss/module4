<!-- this webpage contains some information about me. I tried making the photo of me that i uploaded look "cool" which 
is wgy it has that filter and you can barely see my face. I had this combined with another webpage but decided to make them 
their own thing. so i will add some stuff when i can to fill this up a little more. -->

    I don't know a single thing about me, and that's okay. I'm learning about it, too. I'm just your local kid that likes the simple things in life such as food, a comfortable bed, and the good health and proper growth of everyone else around me. I feel like these words won't do justice to the pictures that showcase my growth from some of the earliest points of my life, to who i am now. so safe travels and learn from it, friend.
