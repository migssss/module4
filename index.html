                I'm not sure what I expected by sharing this with you. I just know that I'm proud of it. 
                I have spend quite a long time alone, but at the same time, meeting new people whenever the chance presents itself. 
                I thought this whole time I didn't have a purpose to capture any more photos when the good times have left me a while back. 
                And then I realized, I didn't want to lose the people I have met after losing everyone, again before.
                So what better way to do it than by saving my photos, pubicly. 
                So enjoy the moments that have made my life so divine to exist.
